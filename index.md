## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in adversarial machine learning and its applications.  <br/>
**Research Work**: Currently, I am working on the following three parts (\* refers to equal contributions.):

(1) Towards trustworthy foundation models. <br/>
- Enhancing Adversarial Contrastive Learning via Adversarial Invariant Regularization (NeurIPS'23) [paper]() [code]()
<br/> **Xilie Xu\***, Jingfeng Zhang\*, Feng Liu, Masashi Sugiyama, Mohan Kankanhalli

- Efficient Adversarial Contrastive Learning via Robustness-Aware Coreset Selection (NeurIPS'23, Spotlight) [paper]() [code]()
<br/> **Xilie Xu\***, Jingfeng Zhang\*, Feng Liu, Masashi Sugiyama, Mohan Kankanhalli

(2) Evaluating robustness of AI-powered applications including non-parametric two-sample tests, large language models (LLMs), diffusion models. <br/>

(3) Enhancing standard adversarial learning. <br/>
