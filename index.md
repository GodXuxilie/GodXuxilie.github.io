Here is **Xilie Xu (徐曦烈)**. <br/>
I am a third-year PhD student at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) supervised by [Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/) and co-advised by [Prof. Jingfeng Zhang](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/jingfeng-zhang). Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [Honored Taishan College](https://www.tsxt.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2021.

## Research Interest
I am broadly interested in **adversarial machine learning** and its applications. My current research focuses on developing adversarially robust foundation models, as well as evaluating and enhancing the adversarial robustness of AI-powered applications (e.g., statistical models, LLMs, diffusion models). <br/>
