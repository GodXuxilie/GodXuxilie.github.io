## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in adversarial machine learning and its applications.  <br/>
**Research Work**: Currently, I am working on the following three parts (\* refers to equal contributions.):

(1) Improving supervised adversarial learning where label information is required. <br/>
  - NoiLin: Improving Adversarial Training and Correcting Stereotype of Noisy Labels (TMLR 2022) [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=zlQXV7xtZs) [code](https://github.com/zjfheart/NoiLIn) <br>Jingfeng Zhang*, **Xilie Xu\***, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu, Lizhen Cui, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama
  - 
- Towards effective and efficient self-supervised adversarial learning without requiring annotations.
- Robustifying AI-powered tools such as non-parametric two-sample tests.
