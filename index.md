## Research Interests

Research Interest: I am broadly interested in adversarial machine learning and its applications. Currently, I am working on the following three parts: 

- Improving supervised adversarial learning where label information is required.
- Towards effective and efficient self-supervised adversarial learning without requiring annotations.
- Robustifying AI-powered tools such as non-parametric two-sample tests.
