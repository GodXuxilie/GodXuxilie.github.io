Here is **Xilie Xu (ÂæêÊõ¶ÁÉà)**. <br/>
I am a third-year (Aug. 2021-present) Ph.D. student at [the School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) of [the National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) fortunately advised by [Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/). Before that, I received my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from [Taishan College](https://www.tsxt.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2021.
